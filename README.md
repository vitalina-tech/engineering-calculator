# Engineering Calculator
A Python desktop calculator starting with unit conversion and growing toward full engineering functionality

## Current Features
- Length unit conversion (m, ft, in, yd, mi)
- Clean GUI built with Tkinter
- Input validation and error handling

## Current Status  
ðŸš§ **Version 0.1** - Basic unit converter implemented

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add more unit types (weight, temperature, volume)
- [ ] Basic math operations (+, -, Ã—, Ã·)
- [ ] Scientific functions (sin, cos, log, etc.)
- [ ] Engineering calculations (area, volume formulas)
- [ ] History and memory functions
- [ ] Advanced math (derivatives, integrals with sympy)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Math libraries (planned: numpy, scipy, sympy)

## Getting Started
```python
python calculator.py
